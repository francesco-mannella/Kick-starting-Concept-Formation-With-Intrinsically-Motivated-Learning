# Kick-starting-Concept-Formation-With-Intrinsically-Motivated-Learning

## Description
This code implements a simulated agent in 2D environment with [box2d](https://box2d.org/) physics. The agent is a 3-DoF arm with a 2-DoF gripper. The environment is also filled with an object. The agent is controlled by a computational model which learns a map of its sensorimotor contingencies via the interaction with the environment. The model is described in the paper: Mannella F., Tummolini L. "Kick-starting concept formation with intrinsically motivated learning: The grounding by competence acquisition hypothesis" (2022) https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2021.0370 .
